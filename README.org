#+TITLE: tspew - an Emacs minor mode for viewing template-related errors in C++ compilation

* tspew addresses the "template spew" problem for C++ coders
This minor mode runs during compilation of C++ code and reformats long error messages to be easier to read.
It indents template type names according to their hierarchy, adding newlines as required
to eliminate run-on lines.

* Usage
** Install tspew.el somewhere in your `load-path`
** In your init file:
- ~(require 'tspew)~ or otherwise specify it should be loaded (e.g. with ~use-package~)
- Ensure it runs during compilation with ~(add-hook 'compilation-mode-hook 'tspew-mode)~
